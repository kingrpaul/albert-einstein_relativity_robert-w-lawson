				<p epub:type="bridgehead">The Space-Time Continuum of the Special Theory of Relativity Considered as a
					Euclidean Continuum.</p>
			</header>
			<p>We are now in a position to formulate more exactly the idea of Minkowski, which was only vaguely
				indicated in Section XVII. In accordance with the special theory of relativity,
				certain coordinate systems are given preference for the description of the four-dimensional, space-time
				continuum. We called these “Galileian coordinate systems.” For these systems, the four coordinates <span
					class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f82frml" src="../images/inline-f82.svg"
						title="x comma y comma z comma t" /></span>, which determine an event or⁠—in other words, a
				point of the four-dimensional continuum⁠—are defined physically in a simple manner, as set forth in
				detail in the first part of this book. For the transition from one Galileian system to another, which is
				moving uniformly with reference to the first, the equations of the Lorentz transformation are valid.
				These last form the basis for the derivation of deductions from the special theory of relativity, and in
				themselves they are nothing more than the expression of the universal validity of the law of
				transmission of light for all Galileian systems of reference.</p>
			<p>Minkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy the following simple conditions. Let us consider
				two neighbouring events, the relative position of which in the four-dimensional continuum is given with
				respect to a Galileian reference-body <i>K</i> by the space coordinate
				differences <span><img alt=""  src="../images/inline-f339.svg"
						title="d x comma d y comma d z" /></span> and the time-difference <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>dt</i>. With reference to a second Galileian system we shall suppose
				that the corresponding differences for these two events are <span><img alt=""
						 src="../images/inline-f341.svg"
						title="d  x Superscript prime Baseline comma d y Superscript prime Baseline comma d z Superscript prime Baseline comma d t prime" /></span>.
				Then these magnitudes always fulfil the condition<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-23"
					epub:type="noteref">23</a>. <span class="displayMath"><img alt="" 
						src="../images/display-f342.svg"
						title="d x squared plus d y squared plus d z squared minus c squared d t squared equals d x Superscript prime 2 Baseline plus d y Superscript prime 2 Baseline plus d z Superscript prime 2 Baseline minus c squared d t Superscript prime 2 Baseline period" /></span>
			</p>
			<p>The validity of the Lorentz transformation follows from this condition. We can express this as follows:
				The magnitude <span class="displayMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/display-f343.svg"
						title="d s squared equals d x squared plus d y squared plus d z squared minus c squared d t squared comma" /></span>
				which belongs to two adjacent points of the four-dimensional space-time continuum, has the same value
				for all selected (Galileian) reference-bodies. If we replace <span><img alt=""
						class="f78frml" src="../images/inline-f78.svg" title="x comma y comma z" /></span>, <span
					class="inlineMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/inline-f345.svg"
						title="StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot c t" /></span>, by <span><img alt=""
						 src="../images/inline-f329.svg"
						title="x 1 comma  x 2 comma x 3 comma x 4" /></span>, we also obtain the result that <span
					class="displayMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/display-f347.svg"
						title="d s squared equals d  x 1 squared plus d x 2 squared plus d x 3 squared plus d x 4 squared" /></span>
				is independent of the choice of the body of reference. We call the magnitude <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>ds</i> the “distance” apart of the two events or four-dimensional
				points.</p>
			<p>Thus, if we choose as time-variable the imaginary variable <span><img alt=""
						 src="../images/inline-f345.svg"
						title="StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot c t" /></span> instead of the real quantity <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>t</i>, we can regard the space-time continium⁠—in accordance with the
				special theory of relativity⁠—as a “Euclidean” four-dimensional continuum, a result which follows from
				the considerations of the preceding section.</p>
