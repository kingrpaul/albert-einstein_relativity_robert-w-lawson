				<p epub:type="bridgehead">Theorem of the Addition of Velocities.<br />
					The Experiment of Fizeau.</p>
			</header>
			<p>Now in practice we can move clocks and measuring-rods only with velocities that are small compared with
				the velocity of light; hence we shall hardly be able to compare the results of the previous section
				directly with the reality. But, on the other hand, these results must strike you as being very singular,
				and for that reason I shall now draw another conclusion from the theory, one which can easily be derived
				from the foregoing considerations, and which has been most elegantly confirmed by experiment.</p>
			<p>In Section VI we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities in one direction in
				the form which also results from the hypotheses of classical mechanics. This theorem can also be deduced
				readily from the Galilei transformation (Section XI). In place of the man walking
				inside the carriage, we introduce a point moving relatively to the coordinate system <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span> in accordance with the equation <span class="displayMath"><img
						alt=""  src="../images/display-f143.svg"
						title="x prime equals w t Superscript prime Baseline period" /></span></p>
			<p>By means of the first and fourth equations of the Galilei transformation we can express <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>x′</i></span> and <span><i>t′</i></span> in terms of <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span> and <span><i>t</i></span>, and we then obtain
				<span class="displayMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/display-f148.svg"
						title="x equals left-parenthesis" /> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> plus w
					right-parenthesis t period"/&gt;</span></p>
			<p>This equation expresses nothing else than the law of motion of the point with reference to the system
				<span><i>K</i></span> (of the man with reference to the embankment). We denote this
				velocity by the symbol <span><i>W</i></span>, and we then obtain, as in Section <a
					href="#ch6">VI</a>, <span class="labeledMath"><span class="leftMathLabel">(A)</span><span
						class="displayMath" id="eqna"><img alt=""  src="../images/display-eqna.svg"
							title="upper W equals" /> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> plus w"/&gt;</span><span
						class="rightMathLabel">(A)</span></span></p>
			<p>But we can carry out this consideration just as well on the basis of the theory of relativity. In the
				equation <span class="displayMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/display-f157.svg"
						title="x prime equals w t prime" /></span> we must then express <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>x′</i></span> and <span><i>t′</i></span> in terms of <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span> and <span><i>t</i></span>, making use of the
				first and fourth equations of the <i>Lorentz transformation.</i> Instead of the equation (<a
					href="#eqna">A</a>) we then obtain the equation <span class="labeledMath"><span
						class="leftMathLabel">(B)</span><span class="displayMath" id="eqnb"><img alt=""
							 src="../images/display-eqnb.svg"
							title="upper W equals StartStartFraction" /> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> plus w
						OverOver 1 plus StartFraction <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> w Over c squared
						EndFraction EndEndFraction"/&gt;</span><span class="rightMathLabel">(B)</span></span> which
				corresponds to the theorem of addition for velocities in one direction according to the theory of
				relativity. The question now arises as to which of these two theorems is the better in accord with
				experience. On this point we are enlightened by a most important experiment which the brilliant
				physicist Fizeau performed more than half a century ago, and which has been repeated since then by some
				of the best experimental physicists, so that there can be no doubt about its result. The experiment is
				concerned with the following question. Light travels in a motionless liquid with a particular velocity
				<span><i>w</i></span>. How quickly does it travel in the direction of the arrow in
				the tube <span><i>T</i></span> (see the accompanying diagram, Figure <a
					href="#fig03">3</a>) when the liquid above mentioned is flowing through the tube with a velocity
				<span><i>v</i></span>?</p>
			<div class="fig03width figure" id="fig03">lang="<span epub:type="z3998:roman">xx</span>" xml:lang="<span
					epub:type="z3998:roman">xx</span>"&gt; <img alt="Fig. 3" height="63" src="../images/fig03.png"
					width="276" />
				<p class="figureHead">Fig. 3</p>
			</div>
			<p>In accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly have to take for granted that the
				propagation of light always takes place with the same velocity <span><i>w</i></span>
				<i>with respect to the liquid</i>, whether the latter is in motion with reference to other bodies or
				not. The velocity of light relative to the liquid and the velocity of the latter relative to the tube
				are thus known, and we require the velocity of light relative to the tube.</p>
			<p>It is clear that we have the problem of Section VI again before us. The tube plays the
				part of the railway embankment or of the coordinate system <span><i>K</i></span>, the
				liquid plays the part of the carriage or of the coordinate system <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span>, and finally, the light plays the part of the man walking along
				the carriage, or of the moving point in the present section. If we denote the velocity of the light
				relative to the tube by <span><i>W</i></span>, then this is given by the equation (<a
					href="#eqna">A</a>) or (B), according as the Galilei transformation or the
				Lorentz transformation corresponds to the facts. Experiment<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11"
					id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a> decides in favour of equation B)
				derived from the theory of relativity, and the agreement is, indeed, very exact. According to recent and
				most excellent measurements by Zeeman, the influence of the velocity of flow <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span> on the propagation of light is represented by formula (<a
					href="#eqnb">B</a>) to within one percent.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless we must now draw attention to the fact that a theory of this phenomenon was given by <abbr
					epub:type="z3998:given-name">H. A.</abbr> Lorentz long before the statement of the theory of
				relativity. This theory was of a purely electrodynamical nature, and was obtained by the use of
				particular hypotheses as to the electromagnetic structure of matter. This circumstance, however, does
				not in the least diminish the conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test in favour of the theory
				of relativity, for the electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz, on which the original theory was based, in no
				way opposes the theory of relativity. Rather has the latter been developed from electrodynamics as an
				astoundingly simple combination and generalisation of the hypotheses, formerly independent of each
				other, on which electrodynamics was built.</p>
