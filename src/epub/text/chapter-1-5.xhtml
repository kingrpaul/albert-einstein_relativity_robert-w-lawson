				<p epub:type="bridgehead">The Principle of Relativity in the Restricted Sense.</p>
			</header>
			<p>In order to attain the greatest possible clearness, let us return to our example of the railway carriage
				supposed to be travelling uniformly. We call its motion a uniform translation (“uniform” because it is
				of constant velocity and direction, “translation” because although the carriage changes its position
				relative to the embankment yet it does not rotate in so doing). Let us imagine a raven flying through
				the air in such a manner that its motion, as observed from the embankment, is uniform and in a straight
				line. If we were to observe the flying raven from the moving railway carriage. we should find that the
				motion of the raven would be one of different velocity and direction, but that it would still be uniform
				and in a straight line. Expressed in an abstract manner we may say: If a mass <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>m</i></span> is moving uniformly in a straight line with respect to a
				coordinate system <span><i>K</i></span>, then it will also be moving uniformly and in
				a straight line relative to a second coordinate system <span><i>K′</i></span>
				provided that the latter is executing a uniform translatory motion with respect to <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>. In accordance with the discussion contained in the preceding
				section, it follows that:</p>
			<p>If <span><i>K</i></span> is a Galileian coordinate system. then every other coordinate
				system <span><i>K′</i></span> is a Galileian one, when, in relation to <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>, it is in a condition of uniform motion of translation. Relative
				to <span><i>K′</i></span> the mechanical laws of Galilei-Newton hold good exactly as
				they do with respect to <span><i>K</i></span>.</p>
			<p>We advance a step farther in our generalisation when we express the tenet thus: If, relative to <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>, <span><i>K′</i></span> is a uniformly moving
				coordinate system devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena run their course with respect to <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span> according to exactly the same general laws as with respect to
				<span><i>K</i></span>. This statement is called the <i>principle of relativity</i>
				(in the restricted sense).</p>
			<p>As long as one was convinced that all natural phenomena were capable of representation with the help of
				classical mechanics, there was no need to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity. But in
				view of the more recent development of electrodynamics and optics it became more and more evident that
				classical mechanics affords an insufficient foundation for the physical description of all natural
				phenomena. At this juncture the question of the validity of the principle of relativity became ripe for
				discussion, and it did not appear impossible that the answer to this question might be in the negative.
			</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset speak very much in favour of the validity
				of the principle of relativity. Even though classical mechanics does not supply us with a sufficiently
				broad basis for the theoretical presentation of all physical phenomena, still we must grant it a
				considerable measure of “truth,” since it supplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies
				with a delicacy of detail little short of wonderful. The principle of relativity must therefore apply
				with great accuracy in the domain of <i>mechanics.</i> But that a principle of such broad generality
				should hold with such exactness in one domain of phenomena, and yet should be invalid for another, is a
				priori not very probable.</p>
			<p>We now proceed to the second argument, to which, moreover, we shall return later. If the principle of
				relativity (in the restricted sense) does not hold, then the Galileian coordinate systems <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>, <span><i>K′</i></span>, <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K″</i></span>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, which are moving uniformly relative to each
				other, will not be <i>equivalent</i> for the description of natural phenomena. In this case we should be
				constrained to believe that natural laws are capable of being formulated in a particularly simple
				manner, and of course only on condition that, from amongst all possible Galileian coordinate systems, we
				should have chosen <i>one</i> (<span><img alt="" class="f17frml"
						src="../images/inline-f17.svg" title="upper K 0" /></span>) of a particular state of motion as
				our body of reference. We should then be justified (because of its merits for the description of natural
				phenomena) in calling this system “absolutely at rest,” and all other Galileian systems <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span> “in motion.” If, for instance, our embankment were the system
				<span><img alt="" class="f17frml" src="../images/inline-f17.svg"
						title="upper K 0" /></span> then our railway carriage would be a system <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>, relative to which less simple laws would hold than with respect
				to <span><img alt="" class="f17frml" src="../images/inline-f17.svg"
						title="upper K 0" /></span>. This diminished simplicity would be due to the fact that the
				carriage <span><i>K</i></span> would be in motion (<i><abbr
						epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr></i> “really”) with respect to <span
					class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f17frml" src="../images/inline-f17.svg"
						title="upper K 0" /></span>. In the general laws of nature which have been formulated with
				reference to <span><i>K</i></span>, the magnitude and direction of the velocity of
				the carriage would necessarily play a part. We should expect, for instance, that the note emitted by an
				organpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of travel would be different from that emitted
				if the axis of the pipe were placed perpendicular to this direction.</p>
			<p>Now in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the sun, our earth is comparable with a railway carriage
				travelling with a velocity of about 30 kilometres per second. If the principle of relativity were not
				valid we should therefore expect that the direction of motion of the earth at any moment would enter
				into the laws of nature, and also that physical systems in their behaviour would be dependent on the
				orientation in space with respect to the earth. For owing to the alteration in direction of the velocity
				of revolution of the earth in the course of a year, the earth cannot be at rest relative to the
				hypothetical system <span><img alt="" class="f17frml" src="../images/inline-f17.svg"
						title="upper K 0" /></span> throughout the whole year. However, the most careful observations
				have never revealed such anisotropic properties in terrestrial physical space, <i><abbr
						epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr></i> a physical non-equivalence of different directions.
				This is very powerful argument in favour of the principle of relativity.</p>
