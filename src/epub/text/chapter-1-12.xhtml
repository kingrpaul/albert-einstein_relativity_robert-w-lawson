				</header>
				<p>Place a metre-rod in the <span class="inlineMath"><i>x′</i></span>-axis of <span class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span> in such a manner that one end (the beginning) coincides with the point <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f110frml" src="../images/inline-f110.svg" title="x prime equals 0"/></span> whilst the other end (the end of the rod) coincides with the point <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f111frml" src="../images/inline-f111.svg" title="x prime equals 1"/></span>. What is the length of the metre-rod relatively to the system <span class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>? In order to learn this, we need only ask where the beginning of the rod and the end of the rod lie with respect to <span class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span> at a particular time <span class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span> of the system <span class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>. By means of the first equation of the Lorentz transformation the values of these two points at the time <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f116frml" src="../images/inline-f116.svg" title="t equals 0"/></span> can be shown to be <span class="displayMath"><img alt="" class="f117frml" src="../images/display-f117.svg" title="StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column"/></span> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">x</span> Subscript left-parenthesis beginning of rod right-parenthesis 2nd Column equals 3rd Column 0 dot StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot 2nd Row 1st Column <span epub:type="z3998:roman">x</span> Subscript left-parenthesis end of rod right-parenthesis 2nd Column equals 3rd Column 1 dot StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> <span>squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndLayout"</span> the distance between the points being <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f118frml" src="../images/inline-f118.svg" title="StartRoot 1 minus"/></span><span epub:type="z3998:roman">v squared slash c squared EndRoot"/&gt;</span>.</p>
				<p>But the metre-rod is moving with the velocity <span class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span> relative to <span class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>. It therefore follows that the length of a rigid metre-rod moving in the direction of its length with a velocity <span class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span> is <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f118frml" src="../images/inline-f118.svg" title="StartRoot 1 minus"/> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared slash c squared EndRoot"/&gt;</span> of a metre. The rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest, and the more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod. For the velocity <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f121frml" src="../images/inline-f121.svg" title="v equals c"/></span> we should have <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f122frml" src="../images/inline-f122.svg" title="StartRoot 1 minus v squared slash c squared EndRoot equals 0"/></span>, and for still greater velocities the square-root becomes imaginary. From this we conclude that in the theory of relativity the velocity <span class="inlineMath"><i>c</i></span> plays the part of a limiting velocity, which can neither be reached nor exceeded by any real body.</p>
				<p>Of course this feature of the velocity <span class="inlineMath"><i>c</i></span> as a limiting velocity also clearly follows from the equations of the Lorentz transformation, for these became meaningless if we choose values of <span class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span> greater than <span class="inlineMath"><i>c</i></span>.</p>
				<p>If, on the contrary, we had considered a metre-rod at rest in the <span class="inlineMath"><i>x</i></span>-axis with respect to <span class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>, then we should have found that the length of the rod as judged from <span class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span> would have been <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f118frml" src="../images/inline-f118.svg" title="StartRoot 1 minus v squared slash c squared EndRoot"/></span>; this is quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which forms the basis of our considerations.</p>
				<p><i>A Priori</i> it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something about the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the equations of transformation, for the magnitudes <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f131frml" src="../images/inline-f131.svg" title="z comma y comma"/> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">x</span> comma t"/&gt;</span>, are nothing more nor less than the results of measurements obtainable by means of measuring-rods and clocks. If we had based our considerations on the Galileian transformation we should not have obtained a contraction of the rod as a consequence of its motion.</p>
				<p>Let us now consider a seconds-clock which is permanently situated at the origin (<span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f110frml" src="../images/inline-f110.svg" title="x prime equals 0"/></span>) of <span class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span>. <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f134frml" src="../images/inline-f134.svg" title="t prime equals 0"/></span> and <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f135frml" src="../images/inline-f135.svg" title="t prime equals 1"/></span> are two successive ticks of this clock. The first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation give for these two ticks: <span class="displayMath"><img alt="" class="f136frml" src="../images/display-f136.svg" title="t equals 0"/></span> and <span class="displayMath"><img alt="" class="f137frml" src="../images/display-f137.svg" title="t prime equals StartFraction 1 Over StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction"/> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndFraction period"/&gt;</span></p>
				<p>As judged from <span class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>, the clock is moving with the velocity <span class="inlineMath"><i>v</i></span>; as judged from this reference-body, the time which elapses between two strokes of the clock is not one second, but <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f140frml" src="../images/inline-f140.svg" title="StartFraction 1 Over StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction"/> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndFraction"/&gt;</span> seconds, <i><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr></i> a somewhat larger time. As a consequence of its motion the clock goes more slowly than when at rest. Here also the velocity <span class="inlineMath"><i>c</i></span> plays the part of an unattainable limiting velocity.</p>
