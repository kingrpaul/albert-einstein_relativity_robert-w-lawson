			<p>We can characterise the Lorentz transformation still more simply if we introduce the imaginary <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f503frml" src="images/inline-f503.svg" title="StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot dot c t"/></span> in place of <span class="inlineMath"><i>t</i></span>, as time-variable. If, in accordance with this, we insert <span class="displayMath"><img alt="" class="f505frml" src="images/display-f505.svg" title="StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column"/>x 1 2nd Column equals 3rd Columnx 2nd Row 1st Columnx 2 2nd Column equals 3rd Column y 3rd Row 1st Columnx 3 2nd Column equals 3rd Column z 4th Row 1st Columnx 4 2nd Column equals 3rd Column StartRoot negative 1 EndRoot dot c t comma EndLayout" /&gt;</span> and similarly for the accented system <span class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span>, then the condition which is identically satisfied by the transformation can be expressed thus: <span class="labeledMath"><span class="leftMathLabel phantom">(12)</span><span class="displayMath" id="eqn.a12"><img alt="" class="eqn_a12frml" src="images/display-eqn.a12.svg" title="x prime 1 squared plusx prime 2 squared plusx prime 3 squared plusx prime 4 squared equalsx 1 squared plusx 2 squared plusx 3 squared plusx 4 squared period"/></span><span class="rightMathLabel">(12)</span></span> That is, by the aforementioned choice of “coordinates,” (11<i>a</i>) is transformed into this equation.</p>
			<p>We see from (12) that the imaginary time coordinate <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f352frml" src="images/inline-f352.svg" title="x 4"/></span>, enters into the condition of transformation in exactly the same way as the space coordinates <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f351frml" src="images/inline-f351.svg" title="x 1 commax 2 commax 3"/></span>. It is due to this fact that, according to the theory of relativity, the “time” <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f352frml" src="images/inline-f352.svg" title="x 4"/></span>, enters into natural laws in the same form as the space coordinates <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f351frml" src="images/inline-f351.svg" title="x 1 commax 2 commax 3"/></span>.</p>
			<p>A four-dimensional continuum described by the “coordinates” <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f329frml" src="images/inline-f329.svg" title="x 1 commax 2 commax 3 commax 4"/></span>, was called “world” by Minkowski, who also termed a point-event a “world-point.” From a “happening” in three-dimensional space, physics becomes, as it were, an “existence “in the four-dimensional “world.”</p>
			<p>This four-dimensional “world” bears a close similarity to the three-dimensional “space” of (Euclidean) analytical geometry. If we introduce into the latter a new Cartesian coordinate system (<span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f513frml" src="images/inline-f513.svg" title="x prime 1 commax prime 2 commax prime 3"/></span>) with the same origin, then <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f513frml" src="images/inline-f513.svg" title="x prime 1 comma"/>x prime 2 commax prime 3" /&gt;</span>, are linear homogeneous functions of <span class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f351frml" src="images/inline-f351.svg" title="x 1 comma"/>x 2 commax 3" /&gt;</span> which identically satisfy the equation <span class="displayMath"><img alt="" class="f516frml" src="images/display-f516.svg" title="x prime 1 squared plusx prime 2 squared plusx prime 3 squared equalsx 1 squared plusx 2 squared plusx 3 squared"/></span></p>
			<p>The analogy with (12) is a complete one. We can regard Minkowski’s “world” in a formal manner as a four-dimensional Euclidean space (with an imaginary time coordinate); the Lorentz transformation corresponds to a “rotation” of the coordinate system in the four-dimensional “world.”</p>
