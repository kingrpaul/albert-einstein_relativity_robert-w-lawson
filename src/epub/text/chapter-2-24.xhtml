			</header>
			<p>The surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me. I can get from any one point on this table to
				any other point by passing continuously from one point to a “neighbouring” one, and repeating this
				process a (large) number of times, or, in other words, by going from point to point without executing
				“jumps.” I am sure the reader will appreciate with sufficient clearness what I mean here by
				“neighbouring” and by “jumps” (if he is not too pedantic). We express this property of the surface by
				describing the latter as a continuum.</p>
			<p>Let us now imagine that a large number of little rods of equal length have been made, their lengths being
				small compared with the dimensions of the marble slab. When I say they are of equal length, I mean that
				one can be laid on any other without the ends overlapping. We next lay four of these little rods on the
				marble slab so that they constitute a quadrilateral figure (a square), the diagonals of which are
				equally long. To ensure the equality of the diagonals, we make use of a little testing-rod. To this
				square we add similar ones, each of which has one rod in common with the first. We proceed in like
				manner with each of these squares until finally the whole marble slab is laid out with squares. The
				arrangement is such, that each side of a square belongs to two squares and each corner to four squares.
			</p>
			<p>It is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this business without getting into the greatest
				difficulties. We only need to think of the following. If at any moment three squares meet at a corner,
				then two sides of the fourth square are already laid, and, as a consequence, the arrangement of the
				remaining two sides of the square is already completely determined. But I am now no longer able to
				adjust the quadrilateral so that its diagonals may be equal. If they are equal of their own accord, then
				this is an especial favour of the marble slab and of the little rods, about which I can only be
				thankfully surprised. We must experience many such surprises if the construction is to be successful.
			</p>
			<p>If everything has really gone smoothly, then I say that the points of the marble slab constitute a
				Euclidean continuum with respect to the little rod, which has been used as a “distance” (line-interval).
				By choosing one corner of a square as “origin” I can characterise every other corner of a square with
				reference to this origin by means of two numbers. I only need state how many rods I must pass over when,
				starting from the origin, I proceed towards the “right” and then “upwards,” in order to arrive at the
				corner of the square under consideration. These two numbers are then the “Cartesian coordinates” of this
				corner with reference to the “Cartesian coordinate system” which is determined by the arrangement of
				little rods.</p>
			<p>By making use of the following modification of this abstract experiment, we recognise that there must
				also be cases in which the experiment would be unsuccessful. We shall suppose that the rods “expand” by
				an amount proportional to the increase of temperature. We heat the central part of the marble slab, but
				not the periphery, in which case two of our little rods can still be brought into coincidence at every
				position on the table. But our construction of squares must necessarily come into disorder during the
				heating, because the little rods on the central region of the table expand, whereas those on the outer
				part do not.</p>
			<p>With reference to our little rods⁠—defined as unit lengths⁠—the marble slab is no longer a Euclidean
				continuum, and we are also no longer in the position of defining Cartesian coordinates directly with
				their aid, since the above construction can no longer be carried out. But since there are other things
				which are not influenced in a similar manner to the little rods (or perhaps not at all) by the
				temperature of the table, it is possible quite naturally to maintain the point of view that the marble
				slab is a “Euclidean continuum.” This can be done in a satisfactory manner by making a more subtle
				stipulation about the measurement or the comparison of lengths.</p>
			<p>But if rods of every kind (<i><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr></i> of every material) were
				to behave <i>in the same way</i> as regards the influence of temperature when they are on the variably
				heated marble slab, and if we had no other means of detecting the effect of temperature than the
				geometrical behaviour of our rods in experiments analogous to the one described above, then our best
				plan would be to assign the distance <i>one</i> to two points on the slab, provided that the ends of one
				of our rods could be made to coincide with these two points; for how else should we define the distance
				without our proceeding being in the highest measure grossly arbitrary? The method of Cartesian
				coordinates must then be discarded, and replaced by another which does not assume the validity of
				Euclidean geometry for rigid bodies.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22"
					epub:type="noteref">22</a> The reader will notice that the situation depicted here corresponds to
				the one brought about by the general postulate of relativity (Section XXIII).</p>
