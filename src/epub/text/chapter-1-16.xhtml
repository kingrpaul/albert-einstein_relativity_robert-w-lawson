				<p epub:type="bridgehead">Experience and the Special Theory of Relativity.</p>
			</header>
			<p>To what extent is the special theory of relativity supported by experience? This question is not easily
				answered for the reason already mentioned in connection with the fundamental experiment of Fizeau. The
				special theory of relativity has crystallised out from the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electromagnetic
				phenomena. Thus all facts of experience which support the electromagnetic theory also support the theory
				of relativity. As being of particular importance, I mention here the fact that the theory of relativity
				enables us to predict the effects produced on the light reaching us from the fixed stars. These results
				are obtained in an exceedingly simple manner, and the effects indicated, which are due to the relative
				motion of the earth with reference to those fixed stars are found to be in accord with experience. We
				refer to the yearly movement of the apparent position of the fixed stars resulting from the motion of
				the earth round the sun (aberration), and to the influence of the radial components of the relative
				motions of the fixed stars with respect to the earth on the colour of the light reaching us from them.
				The latter effect manifests itself in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of the light
				transmitted to us from a fixed star, as compared with the position of the same spectral lines when they
				are produced by a terrestrial source of light (Doppler principle). The experimental arguments in favour
				of the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, which are at the same time arguments in favour of the theory of
				relativity, are too numerous to be set forth here. In reality they limit the theoretical possibilities
				to such an extent, that no other theory than that of Maxwell and Lorentz has been able to hold its own
				when tested by experience.</p>
			<p>But there are two classes of experimental facts hitherto obtained which can be represented in the
				Maxwell-Lorentz theory only by the introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, which in itself⁠—<i><abbr
						epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr></i> without making use of the theory of
				relativity⁠—appears extraneous.</p>
			<p>It is known that cathode rays and the so-called <span><img alt="" 
						src="../images/inline-f206.svg" title="beta" /></span>-rays emitted by radioactive substances
				consist of negatively electrified particles (electrons) of very small inertia and large velocity. By
				examining the deflection of these rays under the influence of electric and magnetic fields, we can study
				the law of motion of these particles very exactly.</p>
			<p>In the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are faced with the difficulty that electrodynamic
				theory of itself is unable to give an account of their nature. For since electrical masses of one sign
				repel each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron would necessarily be
				scattered under the influence of their mutual repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind
				operating between them, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.<a
					href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a> If we now assume that the
				relative distances between the electrical masses constituting the electron remain unchanged during the
				motion of the electron (rigid connection in the sense of classical mechanics), we arrive at a law of
				motion of the electron which does not agree with experience. Guided by purely formal points of view,
				<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H. A.</abbr> Lorentz was the first to introduce the hypothesis that
				the form of the electron experiences a contraction in the direction of motion in consequence of that
				motion. The contracted length being proportional to the expression <span><img alt=""
						 src="../images/inline-f207.svg" title="StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction" /> v
					squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot period"/&gt;</span> This hypothesis, which is not
				justifiable by any electrodynamical facts, supplies us then with that particular law of motion which has
				been confirmed with great precision in recent years.</p>
			<p>The theory of relativity leads to the same law of motion, without requiring any special hypothesis
				whatsoever as to the structure and the behaviour of the electron. We arrived at a similar conclusion in
				Section XIII in connection with the experiment of Fizeau, the result of which is
				foretold by the theory of relativity without the necessity of drawing on hypotheses as to the physical
				nature of the liquid.</p>
			<p>The second class of facts to which we have alluded has reference to the question whether or not the
				motion of the earth in space can be made perceptible in terrestrial experiments. We have already
				remarked in Section V that all attempts of this nature led to a negative result.
				Before the theory of relativity was put forward, it was difficult to become reconciled to this negative
				result, for reasons now to be discussed. The inherited prejudices about time and space did not allow any
				doubt to arise as to the prime importance of the Galileian transformation for changing over from one
				body of reference to another. Now assuming that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations hold for a reference-body
				<span><i>K</i></span>, we then find that they do not hold for a reference-body <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span> moving uniformly with respect to <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K</i></span>, if we assume that the relations of the Galileian transformation
				exist between the coordinates of <span><i>K</i></span> and <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span>. It thus appears that, of all Galileian coordinate systems, one
				(<span><i>K</i></span>) corresponding to a particular state of motion is physically
				unique. This result was interpreted physically by regarding <span><i>K</i></span> as
				at rest with respect to a hypothetical æther of space. On the other hand, all coordinate systems <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span> moving relatively to <span><i>K</i></span>
				were to be regarded as in motion with respect to the æther. To this motion of <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span> against the æther (“æther-drift” relative to <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i></span>) were attributed the more complicated laws which were supposed
				to hold relative to <span><i>K′</i></span>. Strictly speaking, such an æther-drift
				ought also to be assumed relative to the earth, and for a long time the efforts of physicists were
				devoted to attempts to detect the existence of an æther-drift at the earth’s surface.</p>
			<p>In one of the most notable of these attempts Michelson devised a method which appears as though it must
				be decisive. Imagine two mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reflecting surfaces face each
				other. A ray of light requires a perfectly definite time <span><i>T</i></span> to
				pass from one mirror to the other and back again, if the whole system be at rest with respect to the
				æther. It is found by calculation, however, that a slightly different time <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>T′</i></span> is required for this process, if the body, together with the
				mirrors, be moving relatively to the æther. And yet another point: it is shown by calculation that for a
				given velocity <span><i>v</i></span> with reference to the æther, this time <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>T′</i></span> is different when the body is moving perpendicularly to the
				planes of the mirrors from that resulting when the motion is parallel to these planes. Although the
				estimated difference between these two times is exceedingly small, Michelson and Morley performed an
				experiment involving interference in which this difference should have been clearly detectable. But the
				experiment gave a negative result⁠—a fact very perplexing to physicists. Lorentz and FitzGerald rescued
				the theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body relative to the æther produces a
				contraction of the body in the direction of motion, the amount of contraction being just sufficient to
				compensate for the difference in time mentioned above. Comparison with the discussion in Section <a
					href="#ch12">XII</a> shows that also from the standpoint of the theory of relativity this solution
				of the difficulty was the right one. But on the basis of the theory of relativity the method of
				interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory. According to this theory there is no such thing as a
				“specially favoured” (unique) coordinate system to occasion the introduction of the æther-idea, and
				hence there can be no æther-drift, nor any experiment with which to demonstrate it. Here the contraction
				of moving bodies follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory, without the introduction of
				particular hypotheses; and as the prime factor involved in this contraction we find, not the motion in
				itself, to which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to the body of reference
				chosen in the particular case in point. Thus for a coordinate system moving with the earth the mirror
				system of Michelson and Morley is not shortened, but it is shortened for a coordinate system which is at
				rest relatively to the sun.</p>
