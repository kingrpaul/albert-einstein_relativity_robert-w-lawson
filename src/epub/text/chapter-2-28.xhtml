				<p epub:type="bridgehead">Exact Formulation of the General Principle of Relativity.</p>
			</header>
			<p>We are now in a position to replace the provisional formulation of the general principle of relativity
				given in Section XVIII by an exact formulation. The form there used, “All bodies of
				reference <span><img alt=""  src="../images/inline-f357.svg"
						title="upper K comma upper K prime comma" /></span> <abbr>etc.</abbr>, are equivalent for the
				description of natural phenomena (formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their
				state of motion,” cannot be maintained, because the use of rigid reference-bodies, in the sense of the
				method followed in the special theory of relativity, is in general not possible in space-time
				description. The Gauss coordinate system has to take the place of the body of reference. The following
				statement corresponds to the fundamental idea of the general principle of relativity: “<i>All Gaussian
					coordinate systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of the general laws of
					nature.</i>”<img alt=""  src="../images/inline-f329.svg" title="x 1 comma" /></p>
			<p>We can state this general principle of relativity in still another form, which renders it yet more
				clearly intelligible than it is when in the form of the natural extension of the special principle of
				relativity. According to the special theory of relativity, the equations which express the general laws
				of nature pass over into equations of the same form when, by making use of the Lorentz transformation,
				we replace the space-time variables <span><img alt="" class="f82frml"
						src="../images/inline-f82.svg" title="x comma y comma z comma t" /></span>, of a (Galileian)
				reference-body <span><i>K</i></span> by the space-time variables <span
					class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f81frml" src="../images/inline-f81.svg"
						title="x prime comma y prime comma z prime comma t prime" /></span>, of a new reference-body
				<span><i>K′</i></span>. According to the general theory of relativity, on the other
				hand, by application of <i>arbitrary substitutions</i> of the Gauss variables <span>x
					2 comma x 3 comma x 4"/&gt;</span>, the equations must pass over into equations of the same form;
				for every transformation (not only the Lorentz transformation) corresponds to the transition of one
				Gauss coordinate system into another.</p>
			<p>If we desire to adhere to our “old-time” three-dimensional view of things, then we can characterise the
				development which is being undergone by the fundamental idea of the general theory of relativity as
				follows: The special theory of relativity has reference to Galileian domains, <i><abbr
						epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr></i> to those in which no gravitational field exists. In
				this connection a Galileian reference-body serves as body of reference, <i><abbr
						epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr></i> a rigid body the state of motion of which is so
				chosen that the Galileian law of the uniform rectilinear motion of “isolated” material points holds
				relatively to it.</p>
			<p>Certain considerations suggest that we should refer the same Galileian domains to <i>non-Galileian</i>
				reference-bodies also. A gravitational field of a special kind is then present with respect to these
				bodies (<abbr>cf.</abbr> Sections XX and XXIII.</p>
			<p>In gravitational fields there are no such things as rigid bodies with Euclidean properties; thus the
				fictitious rigid body of reference is of no avail in the general theory of relativity. The motion of
				clocks is also influenced by gravitational fields, and in such a way that a physical definition of time
				which is made directly with the aid of clocks has by no means the same degree of plausibility as in the
				special theory of relativity.</p>
			<p>For this reason nonrigid reference-bodies are used, which are as a whole not only moving in any way
				whatsoever, but which also suffer alterations in form <i>ad <abbr>lib.</abbr></i> during their motion.
				Clocks, for which the law of motion is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the definition of time.
				We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a point on the nonrigid reference-body. These clocks
				satisfy only the one condition, that the “readings” which are observed simultaneously on adjacent clocks
				(in space) differ from each other by an indefinitely small amount. This nonrigid reference-body, which
				might appropriately be termed a “reference-mollusc”, is in the main equivalent to a Gaussian
				four-dimensional coordinate system chosen arbitrarily. That which gives the “mollusc” a certain
				comprehensibility as compared with the Gauss coordinate system is the (really unjustified) formal
				retention of the separate existence of the space coordinates as opposed to the time coordinate. Every
				point on the mollusc is treated as a space-point, and every material point which is at rest relatively
				to it as at rest, so long as the mollusc is considered as reference-body. The general principle of
				relativity requires that all these molluscs can be used as reference-bodies with equal right and equal
				success in the formulation of the general laws of nature; the laws themselves must be quite independent
				of the choice of mollusc.</p>
			<p>The great power possessed by the general principle of relativity lies in the comprehensive limitation
				which is imposed on the laws of nature in consequence of what we have seen above.</p>
