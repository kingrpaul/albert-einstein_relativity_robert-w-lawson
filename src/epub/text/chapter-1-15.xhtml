				<p epub:type="bridgehead">General Results of the Theory.</p>
			</header>
			<p>It is clear from our previous considerations that the (special) theory of relativity has grown out of
				electrodynamics and optics. In these fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of theory,
				but it has considerably simplified the theoretical structure, <i><abbr
						epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr></i> the derivation of laws, and⁠—what is incomparably
				more important⁠—it has considerably reduced the number of independent hypotheses forming the basis of
				theory. The special theory of relativity has rendered the Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the
				latter would have been generally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less
				unequivocally in its favour.</p>
			<p>Classical mechanics required to be modified before it could come into line with the demands of the
				special theory of relativity. For the main part, however, this modification affects only the laws for
				rapid motions, in which the velocities of matter <span><i>v</i></span> are not very
				small as compared with the velocity of light. We have experience of such rapid motions only in the case
				of electrons and ions; for other motions the variations from the laws of classical mechanics are too
				small to make themselves evident in practice. We shall not consider the motion of stars until we come to
				speak of the general theory of relativity. In accordance with the theory of relativity the kinetic
				energy of a material point of mass <span><i>m</i></span> is no longer given by the
				well-known expression <span class="displayMath"><img alt="" 
						src="../images/display-f179.svg" title="m StartFraction" /> <span
						epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over 2 EndFraction"/&gt;</span> but by the expression
				<span class="displayMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/display-f180.svg"
						title="StartFraction m c squared Over StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction" /> <span
						epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndFraction
					period"/&gt;</span></p>
			<p>This expression approaches infinity as the velocity <span><i>v</i></span> approaches
				the velocity of light <span><i>c</i></span>. The velocity must therefore always
				remain less than <span><i>c</i></span>, however great may be the energies used to
				produce the acceleration. If we develop the expression for the kinetic energy in the form of a series,
				we obtain <span class="displayMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/display-f184.svg"
						title="m c squared plus m StartFraction" /><span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over 2
					EndFraction plus three-eighths m StartFraction <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> Superscript 4
					Baseline Over c squared EndFraction plus midline-horizontal-ellipsis"/&gt;</span></p>
			<p>When <span><img alt=""  src="../images/inline-f185.svg"
						title="StartFraction&gt;v squared Over c squared EndFraction" /></span> is small compared with
				unity, the third of these terms is always small in comparison with the second, which last is alone
				considered in classical mechanics. The first term <span><img alt="" 
						src="../images/inline-f186.svg" title="m c squared" /></span> does not contain the velocity, and
				requires no consideration if we are only dealing with the question as to how the energy of a point-mass
				depends on the velocity. We shall speak of its essential significance later.</p>
			<p>The most important result of a general character to which the special theory of relativity has led is
				concerned with the conception of mass. Before the advent of relativity, physics recognised two
				conservation laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the conservation of energy and the law
				of the conservation of mass; these two fundamental laws appeared to be quite independent of each other.
				By means of the theory of relativity they have been united into one law. We shall now briefly consider
				how this unification came about, and what meaning is to be attached to it.</p>
			<p>The principle of relativity requires that the law of the conservation of energy should hold not only with
				reference to a coordinate system <span><i>K</i></span>, but also with respect to
				every coordinate system <span><i>K′</i></span> which is in a state of uniform motion
				of translation relative to <span><i>K</i></span>, or, briefly, relative to every
				“Galileian” system of coordinates. In contrast to classical mechanics, the Lorentz transformation is the
				deciding factor in the transition from one such system to another.</p>
			<p>By means of comparatively simple considerations we are led to draw the following conclusion from these
				premises, in conjunction with the fundamental equations of the electrodynamics of Maxwell: A body moving
				with the velocity <span><i>v</i></span>, which absorbs <a
					href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a> an amount of energy <span
					class="inlineMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/inline-f191.svg"
						title="upper E 0" /></span> in the form of radiation without suffering an alteration in velocity
				in the process, has, as a consequence, its energy increased by an amount <span class="displayMath"><img
						alt=""  src="../images/display-f193.svg"
						title="StartFraction upper E 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction" /><span
						epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot
					EndFraction"/&gt;</span></p>
			<p>In consideration of the expression given above for the kinetic energy of the body, the required energy of
				the body comes out to be <span class="displayMath"><img alt="" 
						src="../images/display-f194.svg"
						title="StartStartFraction left-parenthesis m plus StartFraction upper E 0 Over c squared EndFraction right-parenthesis c squared OverOver StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction" /><span
						epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndEndFraction
					period"/&gt;</span> Thus the body has the same energy as a body of mass <span
					class="inlineMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/inline-f195.svg"
						title="left-parenthesis m plus StartFraction upper E 0 Over c squared EndFraction right-parenthesis" /></span>
				moving with the velocity <span><i>v</i></span>. Hence we can say: If a body takes up
				an amount of energy <span><img alt="" 
						src="../images/inline-f191.svg" title="upper E 0" /></span>, then its inertial mass increases by
				an amount <span><img alt=""  src="../images/inline-f198.svg"
						title="StartFraction upper E 0 Over c squared EndFraction" /></span>; the inertial mass of a
				body is not a constant but varies according to the change in the energy of the body. The inertial mass
				of a system of bodies can even be regarded as a measure of its energy. The law of the conservation of
				the mass of a system becomes identical with the law of the conservation of energy, and is only valid
				provided that the system neither takes up nor sends out energy. Writing the expression for the energy in
				the form <span class="displayMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/display-f199.svg"
						title="StartFraction m c squared plus upper E 0 Over StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction" /> v
					squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndFraction comma"</span> we see that the term <span
					class="inlineMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/inline-f186.svg"
						title="m c squared" /></span>, which has hitherto attracted our attention, is nothing else than
				the energy possessed by the body <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-13"
					epub:type="noteref">13</a> before it absorbed the energy <span><img alt=""
						 src="../images/inline-f191.svg" title="upper E 0" /></span>.</p>
			<p>A direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possible at the present time (1920; see <a
					href="endnotes.xhtml#note-34" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a> Note, <abbr>p.</abbr> 48),
				owing to the fact that the changes in energy <span><img alt="" 
						src="../images/inline-f191.svg" title="upper E 0" /></span> to which we can subject a system are
				not large enough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the inertial mass of the system. <span
					class="inlineMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/inline-f198.svg"
						title="StartFraction upper E 0 Over c squared EndFraction" /></span> is too small in comparison
				with the mass <span><i>m</i></span>, which was present before the alteration of the
				energy. It is owing to this circumstance that classical mechanics was able to establish successfully the
				conservation of mass as a law of independent validity.</p>
			<p>Let me add a final remark of a fundamental nature. The success of the Faraday-Maxwell interpretation of
				electromagnetic action at a distance resulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such
				things as instantaneous actions at a distance (not involving an intermediary medium) of the type of
				Newton’s law of gravitation. According to the theory of relativity, action at a distance with the
				velocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a distance or of action at a
				distance with an infinite velocity of transmission. This is connected with the fact that the velocity
				<span><i>c</i></span> plays a fundamental role in this theory. In Part
					<span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> we shall see in what way this result becomes modified in
				the general theory of relativity.</p>
