				<p epub:type="bridgehead">The Relativity of Simultaneity.</p>
			</header>
			<p>Up to now our considerations have been referred to a particular body of reference, which we have styled a
				“railway embankment.” We suppose a very long train travelling along the rails with the constant velocity
				<span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> and in the direction indicated in Fig. 1.
				People travelling in this train will with a vantage view the train as a rigid reference-body (coordinate
				system); they regard all events in reference to the train. Then every event which takes place along the
				line also takes place at a particular point of the train. Also the definition of simultaneity can be
				given relative to the train in exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment. As a natural
				consequence, however, the following question arises:</p>
			<div" id="fig01">"<span epub:type="z3998:roman">xx</span>" xml:lang="<span
					epub:type="z3998:roman">xx</span>"&gt; <img alt="Fig. 1." height="74" src="../images/fig01.png"
					width="442" />
				<p">Fig. 1.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Are two events (<i><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr></i> the two strokes of lightning <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>A</i> and <i>B</i>) which are
				simultaneous <i>with reference to the railway embankment</i> also simultaneous <i>relatively to the
					train</i>? We shall show directly that the answer must be in the negative.</p>
			<p>When we say that the lightning strokes <i>A</i> and <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>B</i> are simultaneous with respect to be embankment, we mean: the rays
				of light emitted at the places <i>A</i> and <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>B</i>, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at the midpoint
				<i>M</i> of the length <span><img alt=""
						class="f49frml" src="../images/inline-f49.svg"
						title="upper A long right-arrow upper B" /></span> of the embankment. But the events <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>A</i> and <i>B</i> also correspond to
				positions <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> on the
				train. Let <i>M′</i> be the midpoint of the distance <span
					class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f49frml" src="../images/inline-f49.svg"
						title="upper A long right-arrow upper B" /></span> on the travelling train. Just when the
				flashes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> of lightning occur, this
				point <i>M′</i> naturally coincides with the point M but it moves
				towards the right in the diagram with the velocity <i>v</i> of the
				train. If an observer sitting in the position <i>M′</i> in the train did
				not possess this velocity, then he would remain permanently at <i>M</i>,
				and the light rays emitted by the flashes of lightning <i>A</i> and
				<i>B</i> would reach him simultaneously, <i><abbr
						epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr></i> they would meet just where he is situated. Now in
				reality (considered with reference to the railway embankment) he is hastening towards the beam of light
				coming from <i>B</i>, whilst he is riding on ahead of the beam of light
				coming from <i>A</i>. Hence the observer will see the beam of light
				emitted from <i>B</i> earlier than he will see that emitted from <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>A</i>. Observers who take the railway train as their reference-body
				must therefore come to the conclusion that the lightning flash <i>B</i>
				took place earlier than the lightning flash <i>A</i>. We thus arrive at
				the important result:</p>
			<p>Events which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not simultaneous with respect to the
				train, and <i>vice versa</i> (relativity of simultaneity). Every reference-body (coordinate system) has
				its own particular time; unless we are told the reference-body to which the statement of time refers,
				there is no meaning in a statement of the time of an event.</p>
			<p>Now before the advent of the theory of relativity it had always tacitly been assumed in physics that the
				statement of time had an absolute significance, <i><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr></i>
				that it is independent of the state of motion of the body of reference. But we have just seen that this
				assumption is incompatible with the most natural definition of simultaneity; if we discard this
				assumption, then the conflict between the law of the propagation of light <i>in vacuo</i> and the
				principle of relativity (developed in Section VII) disappears.</p>
			<p>We were led to that conflict by the considerations of Section VI, which are now no
				longer tenable. In that section we concluded that the man in the carriage, who traverses the distance
				<i>w</i> <i>per second</i> relative to the carriage, traverses the same
				distance also with respect to the embankment <i>in each second</i> of time. But, according to the
				foregoing considerations, the time required by a particular occurrence with respect to the carriage must
				not be considered equal to the duration of the same occurrence as judged from the embankment (as
				reference-body). Hence it cannot be contended that the man in walking travels the distance <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>w</i> relative to the railway line in a time which is equal to one
				second as judged from the embankment.</p>
			<p>Moreover, the considerations of Section VI are based on yet a second assumption,
				which, in the light of a strict consideration, appears to be arbitrary, although it was always tacitly
				made even before the introduction of the theory of relativity.</p>
