				<p epub:type="bridgehead">The Lorentz Transformation.</p>
			</header>
			<p>The results of the last three sections show that the apparent incompatibility of the law of propagation
				of light with the principle of relativity (Section VII) has been derived by means of
				a consideration which borrowed two unjustifiable hypotheses from classical mechanics; these are as
				follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>(1)</span> The time-interval (time) between two events
					is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference.</li>
				<li><span>(2)</span> The space-interval (distance) between two
					points of a rigid body is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If we drop these hypotheses, then the dilemma of Section VII disappears, because the
				theorem of the addition of velocities derived in Section VI becomes invalid. The
				possibility presents itself that the law of the propagation of light <i>in vacuo</i> may be compatible
				with the principle of relativity, and the question arises: How have we to modify the considerations of
				Section VI in order to remove the apparent disagreement between these two fundamental
				results of experience? This question leads to a general one. In the discussion of Section <a
					href="#ch6">VI</a> we have to do with places and times relative both to the train and to the
				embankment. How are we to find the place and time of an event in relation to the train, when we know the
				place and time of the event with respect to the railway embankment? Is there a thinkable answer to this
				question of such a nature that the law of transmission of light <i>in vacuo</i> does not contradict the
				principle of relativity? In other words: Can we conceive of a relation between place and time of the
				individual events relative to both reference-bodies, such that every ray of light possesses the velocity
				of transmission <i>c</i> relative to the embankment and relative to the
				train? This question leads to a quite definite positive answer, and to a perfectly definite
				transformation law for the space-time magnitudes of an event when changing over from one body of
				reference to another.</p>

				<p">Fig. 2.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Before we deal with this, we shall introduce the following incidental consideration. Up to the present we
				have only considered events taking place along the embankment, which had mathematically to assume the
				function of a straight line. In the manner indicated in Section II we can imagine
				this reference-body supplemented laterally and in a vertical direction by means of a framework of rods,
				so that an event which takes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this framework.
				Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with the velocity <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>v</i> to be continued across the whole of space, so that every event,
				no matter how far off it may be, could also be localised with respect to the second framework. Without
				committing any fundamental error, we can disregard the fact that in reality these frameworks would
				continually interfere with each other, owing to the impenetrability of solid bodies. In every such
				framework we imagine three surfaces perpendicular to each other marked out, and designated as
				“coordinate planes” (“coordinate system”). A coordinate system <i>K</i>
				then corresponds to the embankment, and a coordinate system <i>K′</i> to
				the train. An event, wherever it may have taken place, would be fixed in space with respect to <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K</i> by the three perpendiculars <span><img alt=""
						class="f78frml" src="../images/inline-f78.svg" title="x comma y comma z" /></span> on the
				coordinate planes, and with regard to time by a time value <i>t</i>.
				Relative to <i>K′</i>, <i>the same event</i> would be fixed in respect
				of space and time by corresponding values <span><img alt="" class="f81frml"
						src="../images/inline-f81.svg"
						title="x prime comma y prime comma z prime comma t prime" /></span>, which of course are not
				identical with <span><img alt="" class="f82frml" src="../images/inline-f82.svg"
						title="x comma y comma z comma t" /></span>. It has already been set forth in detail how these
				magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical measurements.</p>
			<p>Obviously our problem can be exactly formulated in the following manner. What are the values <span
					class="inlineMath"><img alt="" class="f81frml" src="../images/inline-f81.svg"
						title="x prime comma y prime comma z prime comma t prime" /></span>, of an event with respect to
				<i>K′</i>, when the magnitudes <span><img alt=""
						class="f82frml" src="../images/inline-f82.svg" title="x comma y comma z comma t" /></span>, of
				the same event with respect to <i>K</i> are given? The relations must be
				so chosen that the law of the transmission of light <i>in vacuo</i> is satisfied for one and the same
				ray of light (and of course for every ray) with respect to <i>K</i> and
				<i>K′</i>. For the relative orientation in space of the coordinate
				systems indicated in the diagram (Fig 2), this problem is solved by means of the
				equations: <span class="displayMath"><img alt="" class="f89frml" src="../images/display-f89.svg"
						title="StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column" /><span epub:type="z3998:roman">x</span> prime 2nd Column

						epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndFraction 2nd Row

						epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndEndFraction
					EndLayout"/&gt;</span> This system of equations is known as the “Lorentz transformation.”<a
					href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a></p>
			<p>If in place of the law of transmission of light we had taken as our basis the tacit assumptions of the
				older mechanics as to the absolute character of times and lengths, then instead of the above we should
				have obtained the following equations: <span class="displayMath"><img alt="" class="f90frml"
						src="../images/display-f90.svg" title="StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column" /></span> <span
					epub:type="z3998:roman">x</span> prime 2nd Column equals 3rd Column <span
					epub:type="z3998:roman">x</span> minus <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> <span>t 2nd Row 1st
					Column y prime 2nd Column equals 3rd Column y 3rd Row 1st Column z prime 2nd Column equals 3rd
					Column z 4th Row 1st Column t prime 2nd Column equals 3rd Column t EndLayout"</span> This system of
				equations is often termed the “Galilei transformation.” The Galilei transformation can be obtained from
				the Lorentz transformation by substituting an infinitely large value for the velocity of light <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>c</i> in the latter transformation.</p>
			<p>Aided by the following illustration, we can readily see that, in accordance with the Lorentz
				transformation, the law of the transmission of light <i>in vacuo</i> is satisfied both for the
				reference-body <i>K</i> and for the reference-body <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i>. A light-signal is sent along the positive <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>x</i>-axis, and this light-stimulus advances in accordance with the
				equation <span class="displayMath"><img alt="" class="f95frml" src="../images/display-f95.svg"
						title="x equals c t comma" /></span> <i><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr></i> with
				the velocity <i>c</i>. According to the equations of the Lorentz
				transformation, this simple relation between <i>x</i> and <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>t</i> involves a relation between <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>x′</i> and <i>t′</i>. In point of fact,
				if we substitute for <i>x</i> the value <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>ct</i> in the first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation,
				we obtain: <span class="displayMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/display-f103.svg"
						title="StartLayout 1st Row 1st Column" /> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">x</span> prime 2nd
					Column equals 3rd Column StartFraction left-parenthesis c minus <span
						epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> right-parenthesis t Over StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction <span
						epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over c squared EndFraction EndRoot EndFraction 2nd Row
					1st Column t prime 2nd Column equals 3rd Column StartStartFraction left-parenthesis 1 minus
					StartFraction <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> Over c EndFraction right-parenthesis t OverOver
					StartRoot 1 minus StartFraction <span epub:type="z3998:roman">v</span> squared Over c squared
					EndFraction EndRoot EndEndFraction EndLayout"/&gt;</span> from which, by division, the expression
				<span class="displayMath"><img alt=""  src="../images/display-f104.svg"
						title="x prime equals c t prime" /></span> immediately follows. If referred to the system <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i>, the propagation of light takes place according to this
				equation. We thus see that the velocity of transmission relative to the reference-body <span
					class="inlineMath"><i>K′</i> is also equal to <i>c</i>. The
				same result is obtained for rays of light advancing in any other direction whatsoever. Of course this is
				not surprising, since the equations of the Lorentz transformation were derived conformably to this point
				of view.</p>
